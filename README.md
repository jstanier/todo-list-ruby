# todo-list-ruby

## What's this?
I'm learning Ruby from the Pickaxe book. I'm building this little to-do list application while I do it. I'm sure the code could be a lot better.

Here's a rough checklist of things that I'd like to do:

- [x] Get a very basic command line version working
- [x] Write up how to run it in this README file
- [ ] Learn how unit testing works in Ruby and write tests
- [ ] Store state in CSV format
- [ ] Whatever else I think of!

## Running the program

That's easy: `ruby main.rb`

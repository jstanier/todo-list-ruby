# todo-list-ruby
Learning Ruby from the Pickaxe book. Building this to-do list while I do it. I'm sure the code could be a lot better.

Here's a rough checklist of things that I'd like to do:

- [x] Get a very basic command line version working
- [ ] Write up how to run it in this README file
- [ ] Learn how unit testing works in Ruby and write tests
- [ ] Store state in CSV format
- [ ] Whatever else I think of!
